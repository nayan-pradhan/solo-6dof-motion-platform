## <u>Introduction</u>
We present a new open-source Six Degrees of Freedom (DoF) motion platform that is capable of producing controlled high frequency motion (surge, heave, sway, roll, pitch, and yaw) in 3D space. We introduce and implement the unique idea of flipping a quadruped robot, attaching a modular 3D printed platform (holding the payload) to the feet, and using inverse kinematics to move the attached platform by using the feet as end-effectors in the closed-loop kinematic chain.
