## <u>Introduction</u>
We present an open-source 6 DoF motion platform capable of producing controlled highly dynamic motion in 3D space. The idea is to flip a quadruped robot, attach a 3D printed platform (holding the payload) to the feet, and using inverse kinematics to move the attached platform in the closed-loop kinematic chain. 12 motors works together to produce high acceleration.

Our design is based on the [open-dynamic-robot-initiative](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative).

The platform design, pybullet simulation and robot control framework are fully open source.
